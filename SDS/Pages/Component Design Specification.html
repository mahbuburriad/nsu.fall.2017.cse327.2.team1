      <h1>Component Design Specification(s)</h1>
	  <p>This content serves a basic overview of the design procedures our product's key components. 
	  The tables will exhibit more details on key components: </p>
	  <ul>
		<li><b>Database:</b> We will use MySQL as our database software.  It will contain tables to narrate different categories of data and will also 
	        recite connections and dependencies between each table.</li>
		<li><b>Server Software:</b>Our server software will directly manipulate the contents of the database, based on commands from the Server 
		    Procedure Proxy.</li>	
		<li><b>Client Software:</b>The Client Software will reside on a desktop computer and will be also available on android version.  
		    Its purpose is to present data to the user as requested, and provide an interface so that the user can easily update project information.
			It will handle conflict resolution automatically when possible, and otherwise allow the user to choose which version of an item to keep.
			<ul>
			<li><b>Android Client:</b>The Android client will allow the user to view basic information about and make simple changes to 
			data regarding projects assigned to them. </li>
			<li><b>Desktop Client:</b>With significantly more computing power, screen size, and storage space than the PocketPC, the desktop client will
			provide more significant functionality in allowing the user to view and edit project information.</li>
			</ul></li>
			
       </ul>
      


      <p>Here we are reciting our components by some table:</p>
      <h3>3.1.Database</h3>
		<p>We will use MySQL as our database software.
		It will contain tables to narrate different categories of data and will also recite connections and dependencies between each table. </p>

				<td>The database we are using which will run on a Windows/Unix based computer. All tables will be created by our admin. 
				We will use the  interface to manually enter initial data in the following tables: 
					<ul>
						<li>Address</li>
						<li>Employee</li>
						<li>Owner</li>
						<li>Buyer</li>
						<li>Renter</li>
						<li>Registered User</li>
						<li>House Rent</li>
						<li>Flat</li>
						<li>Advertisement</li>
						<li>System and Contact</li>
					</ul>


				Once these are entered, we will use the data held in these fields as a baseline for our user interface.
				Once the server gets a request for a certain data type from a user it will look up the table that is associated with the requested object,
				then parse the restriction clause and create a valid SQL statement. Once it has generated a valid SQL statement, 
				the server will connect to the database, execute the query and get a PHP ResultSet back. At this point, it will convert the ResultSet to the 
				Object that was requested by the user and send it back to the client via Sockets and ObjectStreams over the network.
				Calls to the database should not take longer than (but should be much less than) 30 seconds and transfers of the each Object over the network
				should not take longer than 1 minute. Conversion of a ResultSet to a PHP Object should take less than 1 second. Data retrievals in general 
				should be less than 2MB.
				A client may also send an updated object to the server, in this case it will convert to a Set and then do an UPDATE to the database. This is a
				basic database call so it should not take longer than 1 second from start to finish.

				<td>SQL QUERY will come from the user in the form of Object.getAll(String("condition1 = condition2 and condition3 = condition 4"))
				We will determine the Project class is associated to the project table in the database and it will generate the following SQL statement:
				It will send this to the database and will get a PHP ResultSet. A ResultSet is easily converted to our object because the column names 
				in the database will exactly match the fields in our class. SQL UPDATE will come from the user in the form Object.update();
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Data</td>
				<td>We’ll take information from user and filled the database by those information. We’ll use valid SQL called through PHP. 
				In every case we will either get a ResultSet (for queries), a working return code or a SQLException. We will handle all type of
				exceptions according to their type.</td>
