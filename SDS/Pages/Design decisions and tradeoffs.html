      <h2>6.0.Design decisions and tradeoffs</h2>
	  <h3>Programming language selecting issues</h3>
      <p>The first issue we have faced as a team was whether to develop our project in Laravel framework or any other framework. 4 members were already familiar with Laravel and one member was familiar with dot net and another two persons were familiar with java. We picked Laravel because of the majority supports it. Then we discussed about the front-end developing with html5 or flash. After some discussion we choose html5.</p> 
      <h3>Task Distribution</h3>
      <p>This one is one of the major issue we've faced so far. One of the member decided to work on android platform, another person on front-end but rest of the five members asked to work on back-end. One person was not enough to complete the whole front-end design. We must include at least one more member to the front-end team. But it would be crucial if we randomly picked anyone, because he/she might not be familiar with html5. Then we decided to divide the whole project into few parts then distribute those among the members so that everybody can show their skill in the desired platform.</p>
	  <h3>Excluded feature</h3>
	  <p>At the beginning we decided to add live streaming video services and some special voice recognition systems. But we don't have that much time to include such features. Time is too short, and we have a lot of features to add and we also have to implement in android platform. Thatâ€™s why we had to exclude those features.  </p>
